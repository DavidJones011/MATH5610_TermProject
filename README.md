When running/piping the documents in Unix it is CRUICAL that you run/pipe the <satellite.py> and <receiver.py> with the prefix "python3" specified as the language and NOT just "python". Running the classes with the "python" prefix will yield inaccurate results. We suspect there was an update in python3 that modified a built-in method, hence the lack of backwards compatibility.

Note: The NumPy library was used so it must be installed on the machine running the program. The class files will automatically import the NumPy library but it MUST be installed for the classes to run.

We tested and developed our code on David's personal computer and periodically ran it through the school's Unix system to ensure compatibility.

# MATH5610_TermProject

The following is a term project for an undergraduate numerical analysis class, fall 2021 at the University of Utah. 
created by David Jones, Lela Feaster and Preston Malen

We were tasked with creating a gps system composed of 3 classes. We have a vehicle, a satellite and a receiver class. The vehicle sends data to the satellite,
which in turn translates the data, computes the posisition, route, and velocity of the car and its posisition relative to the satellite. The satellite takes this data, then sends
it to the receiver where the data is communicated to the operator of the vehicle. The vehicle class was provided, as well as a built in "trip" starting at a lamp post with provided
longitude and latitude coordinates.

To aid the reader's understanding, we have also included the file from the assingment which includes all the prompts and mathematical reasoning (*see hw01_tp.pdf). We were tasked with doing the mathematics
and setting up the equations by hand, and then translating the equations into code. We wrote the project in Python then ran it through our school's system running Unix.
